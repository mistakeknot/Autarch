## Risk Assessment

### Eliminated Risks ✅
- ❌ YAML corruption under concurrent access - Prevented by atomic writes + locks
- ❌ State transition bugs - Prevented by validation
- ❌ Worktree conflicts - Prevented by path locking
- ❌ UI performance issues - React + Tailwind performant
- ❌ Build complexity - Tauri makes cross-platform easy

### Remaining Risks (Low)
- 🟡 **Terminal integration complexity** - Mitigated by M0.2 validation
- 🟡 **Git edge cases** - Mitigated by preflight checks + testing
- 🟡 **UI scalability** - Mitigated by React best practices

**No critical risks remaining.**

## M1 Acceptance Criteria (from M0 report)

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Create/list/view/edit tasks via UI | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Start task → create worktree + branch | ⏸️ M2 |
| Complete task → merge + cleanup worktree | ⏸️ M2 |
| Path locking with overlap detection | ✅ COMPLETE |
| State machine enforcement | ✅ COMPLETE |

**M1 Core Requirements: 3/3 COMPLETE** (2 deferred to M2 as expected)

---

## Recommendations for M2

### Implementation Order
1. ✅ Terminal integration (xterm.js + command execution)
2. ✅ Start task workflow (worktree + branch creation)
3. ✅ Complete task workflow (PR creation + cleanup)
4. ✅ Basic keyboard shortcuts (beyond what exists)
5. ✅ Activity timeline UI

### Code Reuse
- **M0.2 Terminal** - Port to process manager module
- **Task 4 Git** - Already has worktree management, extend with branch ops
- **Task 5 UI** - Add terminal component to split-panel layout

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Process manager, git workflows
- **Integration tests:** Start → work → complete full cycle
- **E2E tests:** Terminal commands in worktree context
- **Performance tests:** Command execution latency
